        <h2>Why I Disagree</h2>
        <p>
          I cannot accept the terms and conditions of WeatherX for the following
          reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The limitations of liability are too broad and may prevent me from
            seeking legal recourse in the event of harm or damages caused by the
            website or its services.
          </li>
          <li>
            The restrictions on use are too strict and may prevent me from using
            the website in the ways that I need to.
          </li>
          <li>
            The indemnification clause places too much responsibility on me and
            may leave me vulnerable to legal action from third parties.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
          I would like to request that WeatherX revise their terms and
          conditions to address the concerns outlined above. If this is not
          possible, I may need to look for alternative services that better
          align with my needs and values.
